# ☀️ SOLBonds - Sustainable NFT Matchmaking

NFT matchmaking protocol with compatibility-based rewards backed by real DeFi yield.

## 💡 Our Solution
SOLBonds combines social gaming with real yield from Solana DeFi protocols.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Compatibility Algorithm:** Gender, zodiac, pets, risk (0-100% score)
- **Time-Based Tiers:** Longer bonds = higher multipliers (1x to 6x)
- **Real Yield:** 8% APY from Kamino, MarginFi, Sanctum, Orca, SolBlaze
- **Sustainable:** Only distribute real inflow ($55.96/day)

## 💰 Revenue Model

- Mint fees: $5 per profile
- Breakup penalties: $5 early, $2 mid, free late
