# ☀️ SOLBonds - Sustainable NFT Matchmaking

NFT matchmaking protocol with compatibility-based rewards backed by real DeFi yield.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Compatibility Algorithm:** Gender, zodiac, pets, risk (0-100% score)
- **Time-Based Tiers:** Longer bonds = higher multipliers (1x to 6x)
- **Real Yield:** 8% APY from Kamino, MarginFi, Sanctum, Orca, SolBlaze
- **Sustainable:** Only distribute real inflow ($55.96/day)

## ⭐ New Simple Rule

Your daily share = (Your Bond Stake × Your Risk Score) / Total Weighted Scores

No fake APR, no magic yield, no unrealistic multipliers.
It uses user-submitted risk level as the weight.

## ⭐ Why this works

Doesn’t require insane yield.

Doesn’t guarantee fixed payouts (so you can’t break the vault).

Keeps “risk-takers earn more” as a fun behavioral mechanic.

Pairs with higher risk scores simply get a bigger slice of the daily reward pie.

Works even if the vault only earns small, realistic yield.

## ⭐ Example

Vault yield today: $50

Two matched pairs:

Pair	Stake	Risk Avg	Weighted Value
A-B	100 USDC	8	800
C-D	100 USDC	3	300

Total weight = 1100

### Earnings

Pair A-B: (800 / 1100) × 50 = $36.36/day

Pair C-D: (300 / 1100) × 50 = $13.63/day

No magic multipliers.
No breaking sustainability.
Just proportional distribution.

## ⭐ Bonus twist (optional but fun)

Make the user enter their risk score during profile creation:

1–3: Stable, safe, low yield

4–7: Balanced, normal yield

8–10: Degens, spicy yield slice

### You can even warn them:

“Higher risk scores earn more, but break-ups cost more too.”

This adds real game theory.

## ⭐ And now this ties perfectly into matchmaking

Risk Score becomes one of the matching metrics, BUT it now also affects real earnings.
So users suddenly care about:

“Am I compatible?”

“Are we profitable together?”

“Do I want a 9? Or is that unstable?”

Spicy.

## ⭐ Sustainability

This model works because:

You only ever distribute yield + fees that actually exist.

No fixed payouts.

No unrealistic multipliers.

No pressure on the vault to print rewards.

It scales perfectly with user count.
